🚀 Introducing My Cutting-Edge Project: AI-Powered Oil Spill Detection System for Marine Safety! 🌊🛰️

I’m thrilled to present my innovative project: "Detecting Oil Spills in Marine Environments Using AIS and Satellite Data Integration"—a breakthrough solution designed to protect our oceans with speed, precision, and advanced AI! 🌍💡

🔍 What It Does:
This system combines real-time vessel tracking (AIS data) and satellite imagery (Sentinel-1 SAR) to detect oil spills faster than ever before! By leveraging machine learning models like DeepLabv3 (92% accuracy!), GRU, LSTM, and Kalman filtering, it identifies suspicious vessel behavior (e.g., sudden stops or path deviations) and correlates it with oil spill patterns in satellite images. 🌊📡

✨ Key Features:
🚢 Anomaly Detection: Flags unusual ship movements (e.g., spills, collisions) using GRU/LSTM networks.

🛰️ Satellite Analysis: Uses DeepLabv3 to segment oil spills in SAR images with 92% accuracy.

🌤️ Weather Integration: Cross-checks with Copernicus API to avoid false alarms (wind, waves, etc.).

🚨 Real-Time Alerts: Automatically notifies authorities, ports, and nearby ships via SMS/email with spill coordinates and ship details! 📲📍

🌍 Why It Matters:
Oil spills devastate marine ecosystems and economies. My project slashes response time, ensuring rapid containment—because every second counts! 🐟🆘
