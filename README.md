Abstract: Detecting Oil Spills in Marine Environments Using AIS and Satellite Data Integration
Oil spills in marine environments pose critical threats to ecosystems and economies, necessitating efficient detection systems for rapid response. This paper presents a novel framework combining Automatic Identification System (AIS) data with satellite imagery for early and accurate oil spill detection. The solution integrates advanced vessel behavior analysis techniques, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Kalman filtering, and rule-based filtering, to identify path deviations and anomalies indicative of potential spills.
Satellite images are analyzed using DeepLabv3, achieving a detection accuracy of 92%, for pixel-level segmentation to identify oil spill patterns effectively. Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) refine path anomaly detection, improving prediction accuracy to 95%. Rasterio-based histogram analysis further enhances the framework's ability to distinguish oil spill patterns from environmental noise.
Once spills are confirmed, the system employs Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) to issue real-time alerts to authorities, neighboring vessels, and ports, facilitating swift and coordinated responses. This integrated approach achieves high precision, scalability, and efficiency, significantly contributing to environmental protection and maritime safety.
